# **C++20 Flowgraph Library Requirements**

## **Overview**
The Flowgraph Library is a C++20-based mathematical flowgraph library designed to model, compute, and optimize complex data flow operations asynchronously. The library should leverage C++20 features such as coroutines and concepts, support callbacks for nodes and edges, and implement efficient caching and optimization mechanisms.

## **Core Features**

### 1. **Graph Structure**
   - **Nodes**: Represent individual operations or computations.
   - **Edges**: Represent data flow dependencies between nodes.
   - **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Graphs must maintain a DAG structure to enforce computational order and avoid cycles.
   - **Flexible Types**: Support templated node and edge types, allowing users to define operations on custom data structures or primitives.

### 2. **Asynchronous Execution**
   - **Coroutines**: Use C++20 coroutines to manage asynchronous execution of nodes.
   - **Node Completion Callbacks**: Nodes should allow callbacks to be registered, triggered upon completion.
   - **Non-Blocking API**: Nodes and the graph structure must support non-blocking execution for use in multi-threaded environments.

### 3. **Callback Mechanism**
   - **Node Callbacks**: Enable users to define custom functions to execute when a node completes.
   - **Edge Callbacks**: Allow edge-specific callbacks to monitor data propagation or dependency resolution.
   - **Event-Driven**: Callbacks should support events like `on_update`, `on_complete`, and `on_failure` to provide fine-grained control over the flow.

### 4. **Caching Mechanism**
   - **Local Node Cache**: Nodes should have a local cache for storing recent computation results.
   - **Graph-Level Cache**: An optional graph-wide cache for sharing data between nodes with common subcomputations.
   - **Cache Policy**: Provide customizable cache eviction policies, e.g., LRU (Least Recently Used) or LFU (Least Frequently Used).
   - **Concurrency**: Ensure thread-safe cache access for concurrent graph processing.

### 5. **Optimization Mechanisms**
   - **Local Optimization**: Nodes should support optimization hints for minimizing redundant operations.
   - **Global Optimization Passes**: Graph-wide optimizations to reduce memory usage, remove unnecessary nodes, and minimize redundant edges.
   - **Lazy Evaluation**: Support lazy execution, calculating node values only when required.

### 6. **Concurrency and Thread Safety**
   - **Mutex Locking**: Provide mutex-based locking for each node’s data and cache to support multi-threaded execution.
   - **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic operations for node state updates where applicable.
   - **Thread Pool**: Optionally, allow users to specify a thread pool to manage node execution threads, providing efficient resource utilization.

### 7. **Serialization and Deserialization**
   - **Graph Serialization**: Provide serialization capabilities for saving and restoring graph state, structure, and cached data.
   - **Supported Formats**: JSON, binary, or custom formats for flexibility and performance.
   - **Deserialization**: Enable graph restoration from saved states, including cache data if applicable.

### 8. **Error Handling**
   - **Node Error States**: Nodes should handle errors gracefully, allowing for retries or callback notification upon failure.
   - **Graph Error Propagation**: Errors in node execution should propagate appropriately through dependent nodes with customizable behavior.
   - **Logging and Debugging**: Provide logging mechanisms for tracing errors, callback execution, and optimization steps.

## **Implementation Requirements**

### **Code Structure**
   - **Namespace**: Use a dedicated namespace (e.g., `flowgraph`).
   - **Classes**:
     - `Node`: Represents a computation node.
     - `Edge`: Manages dependencies between nodes.
     - `Graph`: Main container class for nodes and edges, managing execution and caching.
     - `CachePolicy`: Interface for defining custom cache strategies.
     - `OptimizationPass`: Interface for defining optimization strategies.

### **Design Constraints**
   - **C++20 Standards**: All code should adhere to C++20, leveraging coroutines, concepts, and threading libraries where applicable.
   - **Dependency Management**: Minimize dependencies on external libraries. Boost and STL libraries are acceptable if needed.
   - **Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the library is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
   - **Documentation**: Document public interfaces, with code examples for common workflows, including node creation, callback registration, caching, and optimization.
