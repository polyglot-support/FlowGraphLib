# Contributing to C++20 Flowgraph Library

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the C++20 Flowgraph Library as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows our coding style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use clang-format with the provided .clang-format file
- Follow C++20 best practices
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Document all public APIs
- Write unit tests for new features

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with details of any new features
3. Add or update relevant tests
4. The PR must pass all CI checks
5. The PR must be reviewed by at least one maintainer

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)
