# Contributing to C++20 Flowgraph Library

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the C++20 Flowgraph Library as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the project's style guidelines.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Follow the C++20 standard and modern practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with clear comments where necessary
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use const correctness appropriately
- Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include performance tests for critical paths

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the documentation with any new dependencies or requirements
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
